# Jumping On Planets
On this site you can see how hig you could jump on different places in space using a jumping astronaut!

Ever wondered how high you could jump on the scorching surface of the Sun or the low-gravity environment of the ISS? This interactive simulation brings planetary physics to life.

## Features

* **Realistic Physics Engine:** Every location uses accurate gravity values to determine your jump's height and airtime.
* **Dynamic Visuals:** Each planet features its own unique animated background (GIF) and custom-designed icons.
* **Interactive HUD:** * **Jump Tracker:** See exactly how high you've jumped in meters.
    * **Gravity Stats:** View the specific gravity (m/s²) for each celestial body.
* **Planet Navigation:** A sleek dock at the bottom allows you to switch between 9 different locations instantly.
* **Funny Audio:** The astronaut says "whee" when he jumps, this sound changes pitch based on the planet's gravity—low and slow on the Moon, quick and sharp on Jupiter.

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Planet:** Use the dock at the bottom to choose your destination.
2.  **Launch:** Click anywhere on the screen to make the astronaut jump.
3.  **Track Results:** Check the top-left corner to see your peak height in meters.
